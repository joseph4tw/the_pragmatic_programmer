# Ch 3 Address Book Challenge

From the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/3gn2s2m):

> Design a small address book database (name, phone number, and so on)
> using a straightforward binary representation in your language of choice.
> Do this before reading the rest of the challenge.
>
> - Translate that format into a plain-text format using XML or JSON.
> - For each version, add a new, variable-length field called _directions_ in
>   which you might enter diretcions to each person's house.
>
> What issues come up regarding versioning and extensibility? Which form
> was easier to modify? What about converting existing data?
