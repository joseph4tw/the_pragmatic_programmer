# Ch 3 - Exercise 11

From the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/3gn2s2m):

> You're rewriting an application that used to use YAML as a configuration language.
> Your company has now standardized on JSON, so you have a bunch of .yaml files that
> need to be turned into .json. Write a script that takes a directory and converts
> each .yaml file into a corresponding .json file (so database.yaml becomes database.json,
> and the contents are valid JSON).
