# Ch 5 Exercise 19

From the book [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://amzn.to/3gn2s2m):

> In the FSM section we mentioned that you could move the generic state
> machine implementation into its own class. That class would probably be
> initialized by passing in a table of transitions and an initial state.
>
> Try implementing the string extractor that way.
